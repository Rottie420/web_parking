1. Why can't I see any order history in the app?

we currently dont support order history as we use metamask wallet for transactions.
To view your order history, open the MetaMask extension or mobile app and navigate to the "Activity" or "History" tab. Here, you can find a list of your recent transactions, including orders.
or you can view your history through etherium public scanners.
