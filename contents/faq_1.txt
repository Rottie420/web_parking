What is this platform, and how does it work without registration?

This platform operates on the principle of decentralized authentication using Metamask wallets. Instead of traditional registration, users can log in and access the platform using their Metamask wallet address.

You can disconnect your Metamask wallet by logging out or disconnecting within the platform settings. Ensure you securely manage your Metamask wallet to maintain control over your information.
